# My configurations for my MacOS apps 
Contains all "hidden `.dotfiles` and other configurations files" for the apps / software packages installed on my MacOS. 
This will help setting up a new machine in the future. 

> I use `GNU stow` to 'map' the contents of this directory to the home directory (as the applications expect them). `stow` will create 'symbolic links' (a pointer to the file in this directory). Editing the original file (the one in this directory) or the one at the linked location results in the same (both will get edited as they are linked together / same pointer / same memory address on your computer after the symbolic link)
